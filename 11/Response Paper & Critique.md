# Response Paper
3D modeling is an efficient, contemporary, and costly tool for humanists/archeologists. Photogrammetry can be utilized to help archaeological research like time-sensitive rescue excavation with limited staff, with more accuracy, higher definition, less distorted imagery compared to traditional camera usings by advancing the focal length. It allows archaeologists to pursue more complex, accurate details at unprecedented speeds. The only drawback is that photogrammetry can be more expensive than some of the traditional tools like terrestrial laser scanners. 

# critique of two digital tools: Pompeii: 3D-explorer
## permanence and sustainability: A
This website was launched in 2018 and the last update was in October 2023, with links to its social media like facebook and twitter. 
## openness or restriction of their data: A-
Most data is open, but requires a form to get access, and needs permission for commercial uses. 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: A-
Most of their 3D models are kind of independent about different archaeological sites across the world, and the “collections” are based on theme rather on geographical location
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data): B
As an original work site, it makes sense that it’s more independent and less relying on other sources, but I also wonder if other organizations (academic or commercial) cite or collaborate with them

# critique of two digital tools: Searchable Greek Inscriptions (PHI)
## permanence and sustainability: B
I couldn’t find the place to see when it’s last updated, or the launch date
## openness or restriction of their data: A
It seems that all inscriptions listed are open to public for academic purposes 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: A-
Inscriptions are categorized through region, which makes sense, but not interacting with other inscriptions in different time periods/regions/types
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data):
It’s definitely interacting with all different academic institutions and journals throughout the world
