# Response Paper
A historical gazetteer is a platform that goes beyond the basic functions of a map and further outlines the historical progressions of and across different locations. It connects the spatial and semantic attributes of locations as well as the historical information of the location from past to present. The purpose of gazetteer is to serve for historians and others with a more sufficient information of locations from past to present, with detailed data of how the location might’ve transformed, renamed, and rebuilt for political, diplomatic or military purposes. Pleiades is different from its predecessor Barrington Atlas because Pleiades has more effective precision of any digitized coordinates. Pleiades also has more types of features, as it has more available space and density of features in given areas. In general, Pleiades allows its gazetteer to be more up-to-date and precise with more storage to provide information. 

# Critique of Two Digital Tools: Thesaurus linguae Latinae (TLL)
## permanence and sustainability: A
It’s quite up-to-date as the newest update is in August, 2023. The only thing is their podcast hasn’t been updated since 2019. 
## openness or restriction of their data: B
Most of their data is indeed open to the public. However, most of the institutions they have cooperations with are Western countries, with only three exceptions of Japan, Brazil, and South Africa. Their data is open but restricted within certain languages and regions. 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: A-
Usually they highlight the intersected link within the text in blue, but they also color the headings and other important messages in blue, which is a little bit confusing on which text to click for. 
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data): B
As a national academy in Germany, Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften mostly focuses on its domestic resources and connections, or within the European Union. It inevitably restricted its data connection out of the European context. 

# Critique of Two Digital Tools: Maps of the Ancient World
## permanence and sustainability: A
Definitely catching up with the contemporary sense of the ancient world, cooperating with the public sense of classics such as memes and shots from the film Gladiator. 
## openness or restriction of their data: A
Most data is open to the public, even though there are a few ads pop up. 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: A
I absolutely like how they manage their data and maps, categorizing maps based on myths, political regimes, and different greco-roman literature and cultures is definitely a successful attempt. 
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data): B
This website source mostly comes from his wife and students, therefore less academic with less connection in social networks within the academia (probably no fundings as well). Most sources do not have credits/citations but based on common knowledge, less connective compared with other websites.
