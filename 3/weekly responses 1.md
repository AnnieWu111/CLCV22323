# Response Paper 1
This book section explains the most foundation and basic functions of computational programming and coding. This book section does not aim for a particular argument but rather gives its audience an informative background of computer language and science. It introduces different levels of coding, how it’s processed from source code to output, and possible errors (syntax, semantics, runtime) that might occur during this process. Meanwhile, it further illustrates terminologies such as variable, parameter, and argument. A variable is a name that refers to value, whereas an argument is like a formula to set up a rule for variables. And the parameter is the sample value put into the argument. The author uses some example figures to help illustrate the point, yet those samples are minimal figurative and less understandable nor directive to the readers. Since this book is more informative instead of argumentative, its conclusion is more prone to summarize the function and values of computation coding, and different modes of coding. Personally, I do feel that this book is less illustrative, and I imagined a video clip with a real-time screening of a computer/programmer operating the codes might be a better way to demonstrate ideas, logic, and terminologies.

# Critique of two digital website 1: Pleiades
## permanence and sustainability：B
The visuality of the website does look a little bit early 2000s, but the content is quite updated and recent. 
## openness or restriction of their data：A
Most of the sources are downloadable, and it also has connections with archival websites such as Internet Archive, which some need internal access through university. 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data：A
Most data I downloaded is functional and could be opened through zip file. 
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)：B
It definitely interacts with other database and archival websites. The only thing is, there are only 6 datasets with Pleiades under the Internet Archive. 

# Critique of two digital website 2: Orbis
## permanence and sustainability：A
I like those graphic signs that represent season and temperature. Yet the colour of those routes are indeed quite vintage website colours in the 1980s-90s. 
## openness or restriction of their data：B
Most of the data presented is from Stanford only, and by only three major people (under the “research” section). 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data：A
Stanford definitely does well in terms of making their data and research intersected between each section column. 
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)：B
It’s “orbis.stanford.edu” so it’s understandable that most data are “stanford focus only” with less external sources, as it’s not a platform funded externally through national organizations like Pleiades.
