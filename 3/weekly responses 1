# Response Paper
This book section explains the most foundation and basic functions of computational programming and coding. This book section does not aim for a particular argument but rather gives its audience an informative background of computer language and science. It introduces different levels of coding, how itâ€™s processed from source code to output, and possible errors (syntax, semantics, runtime) that might occur during this process. Meanwhile, it further illustrates terminologies such as variable, parameter, and argument. A variable is a name that refers to value, whereas an argument is like a formula to set up a rule for variables. And the parameter is the sample value put into the argument. The author uses some example figures to help illustrate the point, yet those samples are minimal figurative and less understandable nor directive to the readers. Since this book is more informative instead of argumentative, its conclusion is more prone to summarize the function and values of computation coding, and different modes of coding. Personally, I do feel that this book is less illustrative, and I imagined a video clip with a real-time screening of a computer/programmer operating the codes might be a better way to demonstrate ideas, logic, and terminologies.
