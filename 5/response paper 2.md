This video explains data normalization as the process or rules to regulate data for the purpose of management. In order to do so, all the rows to regulate data must be unique and all cells must be atomic. Within this regulation, the first normal form requires its cells to contain only one single value, and the value should be the smallest unit to break down. For the second normal form, based on the regulation criteria of the first normal form, it further requires its rows/columns to be directly related to each other. For the third normal form, based on both first and second form, it not only requires all rows/columns to be interrelated, but to all have direct correlations with all others. In other words, one column can not be only another column’s affiliated attribute (therefore transitively related to other columns) but shares direct equivalent relationships with all other columns.

# critique of two websites 2: Papyri.info
## permanence and sustainability: B
Most resources seem to be updated in the 2010s, so I guess it’s still quite updated?

## openness or restriction of their data: A
It seems that most data is open to the public, without need of registration or association with certain academic intuition. And registering an account on this website allows and even invites other people to make new changes and projects. 

## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: B
Somehow at the bottom right of the home page, the “BP” section turns out to be “404 not found,” which I attached the link below, but all others are quickly accessible.
