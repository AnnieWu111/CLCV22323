# Response paper
This paper explains some of the fundamental concepts of GIS, standing for Geographic Information Systems. GIS is an integrating technology that helps geographers and scholars analyze social and natural systems. GIS categorizes different features of an area into several layers based on categories, so that it’s easier for analysis purposes. This technology can apply to natural resources management, facilities management, and land management that better regulate different natural and social power systems. One specific example from the second article would be using GIS to help manage archeological remaining materials from sanctuaries around the Hellenistic Attica. 


# Critique of two digital tool 1: The Homer Multitext project

The latest public seminar was in 2019 before covid, and the latest blog post was in 2020. I don’t think it’s sustainable after covid.

# Critique of two digital tool 2: The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls

It seems that it’s mostly supported by Google in 2011, there are comment sections where online users could share information, but it seems less lively and up-to-date since their news letter is also 404 not found. 
## openness or restriction of their data: A 
Most data is open and there are several languages to choose from, including Chinese!
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: B
There are different forms of scroll for different purposes, and in some way interacting with each other, but not necessarily directly connecting with each other. 
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data): B
So far I didn’t find interaction with other academic or public organizations, only it’s powered by google and the foundation is from the Israel Museum.
