# Explore (in ~200 words) the impact of artificial intelligence on academic research and education. Discuss both the opportunities and challenges AI presents in the academic setting, and consider how it may shape the future of learning and knowledge creation.
I believe that artificial intelligence definitely has a great impact in some of the STEM fields, where the regulations are replaceable with non-human operations or maneuvers. Yet I’m skeptical on the aspect for humanities and social science studies, where the research must include human beings or organic living beings to propel and prosper. If we include and invite artificial intelligence into the academic world of humanities and social sciences, then as humans we are acknowledging the sole existence of artificial intelligence also being as individual and independent humans with critical thinking. I can not argue that this acknowledgement is either ethical or unethical, because this acknowledgement or invitation is inevitable and has existed for a while. We have already acknowledged the independent existence of AlphaGo as a human when we invited them to the game table. And I’m also not sure if it’s ethical to exploit or attempt to manipulate artificial intelligence as a modern form of “slavery,” when we acknowledge its existence but at the same time use it thoroughly for our own purposes as only a tool. Moreover, there’s no difference between humans and artificial intelligence in terms of educational and academic training. The academic institution “irrigates” students with knowledge through verbal, textual, and visual messages, whereas artificial intelligence needs binary numbers in bytes. I think there’s definitely lots of space to argue and explore. 

# Critique of two digital tools: Logeion
## permanence and sustainability: A?
You couldn’t necessarily tell when the data has been updated, since most of the sources are also dependent on other online dictionaries, so I assume that it will automatically update as long as those dictionaries work? 
## openness or restriction of their data: A-
Most data is open, but those dictionaries only serve European languages. 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data: B
You can’t link the definition to the online dictionary and only restricted with this one, unless you search the word on the other dictionary yourself
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data): A
Most data is given with citation and sources, it just you have to search it yourself if you want a more detailed explanation of the word. 

# Critique of two digital tools: OCHRE
## permanence and sustainability: A
All data is updated including events, some events are so close-to-date as well as notes for upcoming events, and across the globe from american, europe, east asian, to africa. 
## openness or restriction of their data: A
Most data is open, and you don’t need a CNET id to get into it. 
## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data:
I also like the project gallery, as it not only gives you the textual description of the project, but the visual images (of female scholars, objects, screenshots of running digital programs, etc) as well, making the project more convincing and practical. 
## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data): A-
Most digital research is conducted and regulated by UChicago faculties and scholars, which there’s nothing wrong about it. And some are visiting across the globe to communicate with the globe, but I definitely want to see more collaborations (since it’s digital and the physical distancings should not be a difficult barriers, except for time different)
